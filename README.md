InfoScribe
========

InfoScribe is a research project and collaborative web platform that lets citizens participate in investigative journalism projects by digitizing select data from scanned document sets uploaded by journalists. In addition to public credit for their work, InfoScribe contributors receive unique access to the documents and processes that drive investigative journalism, as well as the opportunity to exchange ideas with the journalists behind this work. By building a centralized community around investigative journalism efforts, InfoScribe also gives small news organizations better visibility and access to the power of the crowd.

While the full platform is still under development, you can see some example pages by clicking on the links below.
